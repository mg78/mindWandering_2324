How is MW freq affected by easy + diff conditions during mental maths qs

# Calculate Cohenâ€™s d

```

A paired samples t-test was conducted to compare mind-wandering frequency during difficult and easy questions. The results indicated that participants mind-wandered significantly more during difficult questions (M = 36.92%, SD = 29.50%) than during easy questions (M = 23.26%, SD = 24.18%), t(41) = 3.41, p < .001, d = 0.53. The mean difference was 12.80 (95% CI [5.22, 20.37]), suggesting a moderate increase in mind-wandering frequency when participants were answering more difficult questions.

```

A Shapiro-Wilk test indicated that the assumption of normality was violated (W = 0.88, p < .001). Therefore, a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was conducted instead of a paired samples t-test.

```{r}
wilcox.test(mw_freq ~ condition, paired = TRUE, data = data)

```
A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test indicated a significant difference in mind-wandering frequency between Easy and Difficult questions, V = 449.5, p = .002. These results suggest that participants mind-wandered more during Difficult questions compared to Easy ones.

####################Multiple regression#################################

```{r}
RQ_1_Reg <- lm(mw_freq ~ condition + set.x + age + gender, data = data)
# View regression results
summary(model)
```

1. Effect of Condition
Participants in the "Easy" condition had 12.80% lower mind-wandering frequency (mw_freq) compared to those in the "Difficult" condition (p = 0.0257).
This suggests that harder tasks lead to more mind-wandering, which aligns with cognitive load theoriesâ€”easier tasks may allow participants to stay more engaged.

2. Effect of Set.x
Set (1 vs. 2) had no significant effect (p = 0.4159), meaning Set 1 and Set 2 were equally difficult/easy as intended

3. Effect of Age
Age did not significantly predict mind-wandering frequency (p = 0.3396).
This suggests that younger and older participants mind-wander at similar rates in this task.

4. Effect of Gender
Women had 15.20% higher mind-wandering frequency compared to men (p = 0.0274).
This is an interesting finding! It could be due to differences in cognitive processing, engagement.















################################################### Research Question 2 #################################################################
Is there a difference in the type of MW in the easy vs difficult conditions


```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

# Reshape data to wide format
wide_data <- data %>%
  select(origID, condition, mw_intent_freq) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = condition, values_from = mw_intent_freq)

# Remove rows with missing values (paired t-test requires complete cases)
wide_data <- na.omit(wide_data)

t.test(wide_data$Easy, wide_data$Difficult, paired = TRUE)


```

A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare intentional mind-wandering frequency in the Easy and Difficult conditions. The results indicated no significant difference, t(26) = -0.77, p = .447, d = -0.15, 95% CI [-26.25, 11.91]. On average, participants reported slightly lower intentional mind-wandering in the Difficult condition (M = , SD = ) compared to the Easy condition (M = , SD = ), but this difference was not statistically significant.

```{r}
shapiro.test(wide_data$Easy - wide_data$Difficult)

```

t-test is valid 


```{r}

# Calculate the difference between conditions
differences <- wide_data$Easy - wide_data$Difficult

# Compute mean difference
mean_diff <- mean(differences)

# Compute standard deviation of the differences
sd_diff <- sd(differences)

# Compute Cohen's d
cohens_d <- mean_diff / sd_diff

# Print result
print(cohens_d)

```

There is no significant difference in mw_intent_freq between the Easy and Difficult conditions (p = 0.45).
The effect size (d = -0.15) confirms that the difference is very tiny.

model_intent <- lm(mw_intent_freq ~ condition + set.x + age + gender, data = long_data)
summary(model_intent)

```

None of the predictors are significant
Condition (Easy vs. Difficult): Participants in the Easy condition had 13.05% lower intentional mind-wandering than those in the Difficult condition, but this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.196).
Set.x: No significant effect (p = 0.481), confirming that Set 1 and Set 2 were equally difficult/easy as expected. 
Age: Small positive effect (Î² = 0.4452) but not significant (p = 0.177) - older participants might intentionally mind-wander more, but this is unclear.
Gender (Women vs. Men): Women reported 11.73% lower intentional mind-wandering than men, but this effect is not significant (p = 0.350).

RÂ² = 0.0706 - Only 7.06% of the variance in intentional mind-wandering is explained by this model.
Adjusted RÂ² = 0.0076 - After adjusting for the number of predictors, the model explains almost no variance.
F-statistic = 1.121, p = 0.3555 - The overall model is NOT statistically significant, meaning that these predictors do not explain intentional mind-wandering well.

```{r}
plot(model_intent)

```


Unlike previous model predicting mw_freq, where condition and gender were significant, this model suggests that intentional mind-wandering is not strongly related to these variables.


Task difficulty may affect men and women differently???
```{r}
model_interaction <- lm(mw_intent_freq ~ condition * gender + set.x + age, data = long_data)
summary(model_interaction)

```

Main Effects (No Significant Predictors)
Condition (Easy vs. Difficult) - Participants in the Easy condition reported 33.53% lower intentional mind-wandering than those in the Difficult condition, but this effect is not significant (p = 0.1395).
Gender (Women vs. Men) - Women reported 24.88% lower intentional mind-wandering than men, but this effect is also not significant (p = 0.1700).

Age & Set.x - No significant effects (p > 0.1).
Interaction Effect (Condition Ã— Gender)
The interaction term conditionEasy:genderWoman = 25.56 (p = 0.3108)
This suggests that the gender difference in intentional mind-wandering depends on task difficulty, but the effect is not statistically significant.

RÂ² = 0.087 - Only 8.7% of variance in intentional mind-wandering is explained.
Adjusted RÂ² = 0.008 - After adjusting for predictors, the model explains almost nothing.
F-statistic (1.106, p = 0.3671) - The overall model is not statistically significant.

No strong evidence that task difficulty (condition) or gender affects intentional mind-wandering.
No evidence of an interaction between condition and gender.
Other factors likely explain intentional mind-wandering better (e.g., motivation, cognitive control, fatigue).

```{r}
plot(model_interaction$fitted.values, model_interaction$residuals)
abline(h = 0, col = "red")


plot(model_interaction, which = 3)  # Scale-Location plot


qqnorm(model_interaction$residuals)
qqline(model_interaction$residuals, col = "red")  # Reference line


```

Linearity - Is good
Homoscedasticity - is good
Normality of residuals - not good - but deviation is moderate
So There is a mild violation 











################################################# Research Question 3 ###########################################################
Test Performance in relation to Mind Wandering


#################### Correlation: to test mind-wandering against test performance#######################

```{r}
cor_test <- cor.test(data$mw_freq, data$mm_acc, method = "pearson")
print(cor_test)

```
Correlation coefficient (r) = -0.5088

This indicates a moderate negative correlation between mw_freq and mm_acc 
As mind-wandering increases, test performance decreases.
p-value = 7.748e-07 

This is extremely significant (p < 0.05), meaning the relationship between mw_freq and mm_acc is unlikely to be due to chance.
95% Confidence Interval: [-0.6521, -0.3304]

We are 95% confident that the true correlation is between -0.652 and -0.330, further confirming a negative relationship.

There is strong statistical evidence that higher mind-wandering leads to lower test performance.
However, correlation does not imply causation. Other factors could also play a role.

```

Only mw_freq is statistically significant (p = 1.54e-05).
This strongly suggests higher mind-wandering negatively impacts test performance.
Condition, set, age, and gender are not significant (p > 0.05), meaning they do not have a strong independent effect on test scores in this dataset.
Multiple RÂ² = 0.3084
The model explains 30.84% of the variance in test performance.
This suggests that other factors (not included in this model) also play a role.
Adjusted RÂ² = 0.2641
Adjusted for the number of predictors, the model still explains 26.41% of the variance.

Residuals do not follow a normal distribution, violating the normality assumption of multiple regression. This can affect the reliability of hypothesis and confidence intervals.
