12533377,18,Woman,Yes,"I felt more focused on the paper task, while for the digital task I felt more tired and mind wandered a lot more. However, I'm not sure whether I fully processed the words in the paper task, while for the digital task I could relatively grasp what was happening. 

Also for the paper task, if reading time was timed, I was very confused about the instructions as to how to read the paper. Hence I just pressed spacebar and next, which doesn't indicate the time I spent to read. (Please put instructions like: only press the spacebar after you flip the page), or a test trial. Since my focus has to be shifted from the paper to the screen, I'm not sure whether it's an entirely fair measure?  

Also, regarding the questionnaire, social media to me is more about replying to/waiting for responses of my friends as opposed to doomscrolling. Which is done but not obsessed over.",75,11859.85277777589,33.333333333333336,11.11111111111111,3.2962962962962967,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,5,4.5,4
