12533358,Digital first,19,Woman,Yes,My experience of this experiment was good. I did find myself looking at the clock to see if I was completing the tasks too quickly.
12533359,Physical first,18,Woman,Yes,this experiment was very interesting and easy to understand the tasks which needed to be completed.
12533360,Digital first,18,Woman,Yes,I found the passages interesting to read about
12533361,Physical first,18,Woman,Yes,"good experience, simple and easy to understrand instructions"
12533363,Digital first,18,Man,Yes,"Shorter than expected, though perhaps this is due to my own reading speed.

Outside of the results and data that are to be used, I did find it enjoyable to test my reading comprehension and short-term memory in such a way."
12533362,Digital first,19,Man,Yes,I personally felt more attentive to the paper condition -despite increased intentional and unintentional wandering- compared to the online condition.
12533364,Physical first,19,Woman,Yes,NA
12533365,Physical first,19,Man,Yes,NA
12533366,Digital first,19,Man,Yes,I found the passages intriguing and interesting to read about so that kept me from my mind wandering too much from the task at hand.
12533367,Digital first,18,Woman,Yes,NA
12533368,Physical first,19,Woman,Yes,The instructions in this experiment were very clear so i understood what i had to do and found the overall experience relaxing.
12533369,Physical first,18,Man,Yes,"very interesting study, feel the presense of another participant could have contributed to mind wandering at points"
12533371,Digital first,19,Woman,Yes,It was harder to focus on the passages I was less interested in.
12533370,Digital first,18,Woman,Yes,The participation was interesting and highlighted to me how my attention can vary depending on the topic/ time length.
12533373,Physical first,18,Prefer not to say,Yes,NA
12533372,Physical first,19,Woman,Yes,NA
12533374,Digital first,18,Woman,Yes,NA
12533375,Physical first,18,Non-binary,Yes,the questions about being on task made it difficult to maintain my concentration on what i was reading and remember what i had read in the early parts of the passage
12533376,Physical first,18,Woman,Yes,"I think there was more pressure on the reading than there would be if we had done it in a neutral, more familiar place so my reading speed increased but accuracy decreased. I think the study was interesting to see and take part in though"
12533377,Digital first,18,Woman,Yes,"I felt more focused on the paper task, while for the digital task I felt more tired and mind wandered a lot more. However, I'm not sure whether I fully processed the words in the paper task, while for the digital task I could relatively grasp what was happening. 

Also for the paper task, if reading time was timed, I was very confused about the instructions as to how to read the paper. Hence I just pressed spacebar and next, which doesn't indicate the time I spent to read. (Please put instructions like: only press the spacebar after you flip the page), or a test trial. Since my focus has to be shifted from the paper to the screen, I'm not sure whether it's an entirely fair measure?  

Also, regarding the questionnaire, social media to me is more about replying to/waiting for responses of my friends as opposed to doomscrolling. Which is done but not obsessed over."
12533378,Physical first,18,Woman,Yes,Very easy to follow instructions
12533379,Digital first,18,Woman,Yes,NA
12533380,Digital first,20,Man,Yes,"The the random questions asking whether my mind was wandering was probably more distracting than my mind wandering every now and then. Overall I quite enjoyed learning what was written, it was fun. I also found myself preferring to read from the paper, it seemed easier."
12533306,Digital first,19,Woman,Yes,it was easy to understand/participate. passages were varied
12533307,Digital first,21,Man,Yes,I found I mindwandered more when I had little interest or were confused about phrased or words in the text.
12533308,Physical first,21,Man,Yes,"Very inciteful, challenging and rewarding. My brain feels a bit strained but I don't think that's a bad thing. This has really made me think about mind wondering. At least until I get distracted by something."
12533310,Physical first,22,Woman,Yes,Some topics were interesting for me which made me focused better.
12533309,Physical first,22,Woman,Yes,NA
12533311,Digital first,22,Woman,Yes,I found it interesting to see how often my mind wandered
12533312,Digital first,23,Woman,No,"amazing experiment, very reflective."
12533313,Physical first,21,Woman,Yes,"I could not concentrate at all, I feel like my attention span has gotten so bad since leaving sixth form."
12533314,Physical first,22,Woman,No,I really enjoyed this experiment - highlights how much our minds wander whilst reading
12533315,Digital first,21,Woman,No,made me realise i need to not use tiktok as often so i'm more focused
12533316,Physical first,21,Man,Yes,NA
