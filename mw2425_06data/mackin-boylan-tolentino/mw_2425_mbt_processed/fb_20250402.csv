12533358,My experience of this experiment was good. I did find myself looking at the clock to see if I was completing the tasks too quickly.
12533359,this experiment was very interesting and easy to understand the tasks which needed to be completed.
12533360,I found the passages interesting to read about
12533361,"good experience, simple and easy to understrand instructions"
12533363,"Shorter than expected, though perhaps this is due to my own reading speed.

Outside of the results and data that are to be used, I did find it enjoyable to test my reading comprehension and short-term memory in such a way."
12533362,I personally felt more attentive to the paper condition -despite increased intentional and unintentional wandering- compared to the online condition.

12533366,I found the passages intriguing and interesting to read about so that kept me from my mind wandering too much from the task at hand.
12533367,NA
12533369,"very interesting study, feel the presense of another participant could have contributed to mind wandering at points"
12533368,The instructions in this experiment were very clear so i understood what i had to do and found the overall experience relaxing.
12533370,The participation was interesting and highlighted to me how my attention can vary depending on the topic/ time length.
12533371,It was harder to focus on the passages I was less interested in.

12533375,the questions about being on task made it difficult to maintain my concentration on what i was reading and remember what i had read in the early parts of the passage
12533376,"I think there was more pressure on the reading than there would be if we had done it in a neutral, more familiar place so my reading speed increased but accuracy decreased. I think the study was interesting to see and take part in though"
12533377,"I felt more focused on the paper task, while for the digital task I felt more tired and mind wandered a lot more. However, I'm not sure whether I fully processed the words in the paper task, while for the digital task I could relatively grasp what was happening. 

Also for the paper task, if reading time was timed, I was very confused about the instructions as to how to read the paper. Hence I just pressed spacebar and next, which doesn't indicate the time I spent to read. (Please put instructions like: only press the spacebar after you flip the page), or a test trial. Since my focus has to be shifted from the paper to the screen, I'm not sure whether it's an entirely fair measure?  

Also, regarding the questionnaire, social media to me is more about replying to/waiting for responses of my friends as opposed to doomscrolling. Which is done but not obsessed over."
12533378,Very easy to follow instructions
12533379,NA
12533380,"The the random questions asking whether my mind was wandering was probably more distracting than my mind wandering every now and then. Overall I quite enjoyed learning what was written, it was fun. I also found myself preferring to read from the paper, it seemed easier."
12533306,it was easy to understand/participate. passages were varied
12533307,I found I mindwandered more when I had little interest or were confused about phrased or words in the text.
12533308,"Very inciteful, challenging and rewarding. My brain feels a bit strained but I don't think that's a bad thing. This has really made me think about mind wondering. At least until I get distracted by something."
12533309,NA
12533310,Some topics were interesting for me which made me focused better.
12533311,I found it interesting to see how often my mind wandered
12533312,"amazing experiment, very reflective."
12533315,made me realise i need to not use tiktok as often so i'm more focused
12533314,I really enjoyed this experiment - highlights how much our minds wander whilst reading
12533313,"I could not concentrate at all, I feel like my attention span has gotten so bad since leaving sixth form."
